	  <!-- ======================================================= -->
	  <hr></hr><h2>Introduction</h2><hr></hr>
	  <!-- ======================================================= -->

	  <p>So, as of this writing (Jul 2004), it's Gates of Discord Era,
	  with Omens of War fast approaching, and all the uber guilds have
	  long since moved on and left Ssraeshza Temple sitting mostly
	  abandoned. Time to see what all the fuss is about.</p>

	  <p>But now you're looking for information about Sshraeshza
	  Temple, aka: Ssra. As a (then max) level 60 monk, I'd learned
	  all about this zone .. my guild was in it for months. Yet when
	  friends asked me for links to good information about Ssra, I was
	  unable to point them to anything other than lists of loot from
	  boss mobs and tantalizing 2 sentence excerpts from sites like
	  theSafehouse.  So I've taken the time to assemble this guide in
	  the hopes of consolidating net information and capturing in-game
	  lore I've learned. </p>

	  <p>If you're in an uber guild, you've almost certainly spent
	  enough time here that you're SICK of this zone.  There are no
	  less than TEN 'boss level' encounters with top notch Luclin-era
	  loot (75-100hp/mana items), as well as the typical smattering of
	  Named mobs (for item and spell drops), two key quests and two
	  bane quests.  You can also xp here in a traditional or AE
	  group. </p>

	  <p>This guide will NOT tell you how to run any of the Boss
	  encounters.  I've fought 'em all, but I only know the way our
	  guild does it .. your guild will surely have a different
	  approach. Besides, it's fun to figure em out. I will, however,
	  mention some things about each Boss fight, as some of them are
	  pretty interesting.</p>

	  <p>Im going to focus on the xp and named camps that you can
	  handle with one or two groups.  Hopefully this information will
	  help anyone who wants to experience a bit of Ssra w/o the full
	  blown 50 person raids.</p>

	  <p>If you happen to be a puller (SKs, Rogues, and Monks; in that
	  order unfortunately) I'll include some pulling information as we
	  go along.</p>

	  <p> Ssra temple is centrally located in TheGrey, an airless zone
	  inconveniently located in Luclin. Srra temple itself, however,
	  has air. Dont forget to take off your EB item when you get
	  there. </p>

	  <h3>Air Travel</h3>

	  <p>The closest portal to Ssra is in Twilight.  You'll head
	  Twightlight -&gt; Scarlet Desert -&gt; The Grey -&gt;
	  Ssra. Wizards and Druids can provide transportation to
	  twilight. </p>

	  <br/><img width="450" height="180" src="travel.gif" alt="travel"/>

	  <blockquote>

		<p><b>Twilight</b>: From the port in point, head directly west
		over the water until you reach a canyon on the west wall of
		the zone.  </p>

		<p><b>Scarlet Desert</b>: Once you zone into Scarlet desert,
		you might want to consider invis. Green mobs can agro and
		annoying you.  Follow the canyon west-northwest, taking the
		right hand branch at each opportunity. You'll eventually reach
		a 'big rock' in canyon with a T-junction after it. Dont take
		either turn.. hop out of the canyon here and continue west to
		the zone out.  Put on your EB gear before zoning in. </p>

		<p><b>The Grey</b>: Put on your EB gear and invis up if you
		wish.  Head due west until you see the Pyramid-shaped
		Temple. The zone-in is on the east face of the temple, so run
		down the ramp (past the golems) and zone right in.  Mobs in
		TheGrey LOVE to stun you (Rock things and golems) so watch out
		for that.</p>

	  </blockquote>

	  <h3>PoK Book Travel</h3>

	  <p>PoK books have made travel around Norrath alot easier, but
	  I'm afraid they don't help you get to Ssra.  All the PoK books
	  lead to racial starting cities, and the only racial class that
	  starts on Luclin is the VanShir.  That PoK book is located too
	  far away to be of any use. If you're trying to PoK book to
	  Sssra, just suck it up and run from the nexus. (See the 'Ground
	  Travel' section below.) </p>

	  <h3>Ground Travel</h3>

	  <table border="0" cellpadding="10">
		<tr>
		  <td><img alt="travel" width="233" height="400" src="travel_ground.gif"/></td>
		  <td>

			<p><b>Netherbian Lair</b>: From the nexus, run til you
			reach the pillar. hang a right and run to the zone
			out.</p>

			<p><b>Marus Seru</b>: Leave the zone-in buildiong and head
			due north-ish til you see the zone out cave.  If you're
			like me with bad Seru faction, you'll have a bunch of
			green Seru lego's chasing you..</p>

			<p><b>Mons Letalis</b>: The main reason NOT to go this
			way. This zone has gotten more people lost or killed than
			I care to remember. Lev / safe fall / Invis is good here,
			as the canyons are steep and the mobs can put a good dent
			in you.  Here's my 'navigation landmarks': From zone out,
			point yourself so you're heading north(west)ish and line
			up so you're going between two peaks/boulders.  Continue
			North, staying HIGH along the ridge line (to your left
			side should be the spire-platform-thing). After you crest
			that ridge you should then stay high on the LEFT of the
			next ridge, still heading north. The zone in should be
			ahead of you.  As I said it's hard to describe and easy to
			get lost. The canyons will NOT lead you to the zone
			out. </p>

			<p><b>The Grey</b>: Put on your EB gear and invis up if
			you wish.  Head due north until you see the Pyramid-shaped
			Temple. The zone-in is on the east face of the temple, so
			avoid the ruins filled with undead and run down the ramp
			(past the golems) and zone right in.</p>

	  <h3>Airless</h3>

	  <p>TheGrey is airless.  You'll need an EB item. The most common
	  ones are the classic <a target="ref"
	  href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1925">Fishbone
	  Earring</a>, or the <a target="ref"
	  href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7557">Amulet
	  of the Grey Wastes</a>.  I DONT recommend spell-based EB or DMF
	  for xp sessions.  They're ok for simply dashing thru TheGrey
	  (aka: Training) to zone into Srra. </p>

	  <p>Some notes about suffocation. As soon as your air bar runs
	  out, you start dying. Death by suffocation is NOT hit point
	  based. You lose a FIXED percentage of your health per TICK of
	  suffocation.  This means you'll suffocate just as quickly with
	  your gear/buffs as without them when you're running nekkid back
	  to ssra for CR.  </p>

	  <h3>Nekkid CR</h3>

	  <p>You KNOW it will happen, especially if you're raiding and
	  need to coffin. (/feedback: retrofit Luclin zones with 20 minute
	  Graveyards!) You *can* make the run from Mons Letalis w/o EB as
	  long as you have a decent SOW.  BEWARE tho .. mobs LOVE to stun
	  nekkid folks. Nothing is as painful as nekkid suffocation
	  corpses littered 'very close' to the zone in..  DA-Type
	  spells/abilities will NOT stop suffocation damage, (Hurm,
	  verify. -Jolo) tho they work well for training past the golems.
	  For raid CR/Coffin work we usualy station a patient druid /
	  necro at the air-side of the TheGrey to EB/SOW/DMF people for
	  the nekkid run to Ssra. </p>

	  <h3>Binding and Safe Spots</h3>

	  <p>You CANNOT bind in Ssra, tho there are several safe spots to
	  camp out or afk for hours.  The zone-in is risky due only to
	  trains. There's a safer spot to AFK, but its in the basement
	  near the mines so its not ideal for CR purposes unless you
	  happen to be camping in the basement.  Other safe spots include
	  numerous 'raid staging' areas on the 3rd floor (the Cell-Room,
	  Insignia toob) and numerous hallways elsewhere .. Ssra's only
	  roamimg mobs are found in the basement. </p>

	  <!-- ======================================================= -->

	  <p>Ok, you've made it to ssra with your xp group or raid. Now
	  where do yo go? First a few words about getting around in Ssra,
	  then we'll dive right into the guided tour. </p>

	  <h3>Tube Travel</h3>

	  <p>Travel between floors in ssra is accomplished by swimming up
	  or down water-filled tubes surrounded by swirling rings. The
	  tubes are short enough that you dont need an EB item.  Entering
	  a tube can only be accomplished through the one 'entrance'
	  that's always facing the door of the tube area.  Exiting a tube
	  is similiar in that you can only exit in one direction: the
	  trick is determining which direction it is. Take your time, you
	  can sit in the tube and rotate until you see the doorway out of
	  the tube room. </p>

	  <p>If your puller has pulled the usual three 'tube guards'
	  before moving up a tube, it is possible to exit the tube w/o
	  agro'ing the 2 guards posted at the ramp to the tube area. The
	  is usually only important when moving to Insignias or the third
	  floor 'Cell Block' as the ramp guards here are much nastier than
	  the usual Shissar. </p>


	  <h3>Invis / Call of Hero / Coffin'n</h3>

	  <p>Invis works on most mobs on the first floor and selected mobs
	  on the 2nd floor. Most noticibly, you can invis safely from
	  zone-in to the basement. Once in the basement watch out for the
	  roaming Taskmaster / Warden, both of which sees invis, but are
	  easy to dodge.  At the first room from zone-in, there's one mob
	  stationed at the door leading to the 2nd floor AL/HP/Creator
	  tube that usually sees invis.</p>

	  <p>Call of Hero works here, with the notable exception of the
	  Emperor rooms past the Emp Portal.  Once you use your key to
	  port into the Emperor rooms, you can't CoH.  Otherwise you'd
	  only need to have a mage with the Emp Key to CoH your entire
	  raid into the Emperor / Blood room.  Similarly, 'ghetto Coh' via
	  SK/Necromancer will also work with the exception noted
	  above.</p>


	  <h3>Restricted Access</h3>

	  <p>Besides the usual rogue-pickable doors (of which there are
	  five(?)), there are several locked doors in ssra that require
	  special mob-dropped keys or items to activate.  The first of
	  these is on the 2nd floor where you will encounter two locked
	  tube rooms. Each of these doors requires a different key that
	  uncommonly drops from either Commander1 or Commander2. The
	  NODROP key, thou not SOULBOUND, once used, goes on your keyring.
	  The 3rd floor portal to the Emperor / Blood rooms is also locked
	  and requires an item, the Ring of the Shissar, to activate.</p>


	  <h3>Corpse Recovery</h3>

	  <p>Corpse recovery in Ssra can be a real pain. There are
	  restricted access areas that may make it difficult or impossible
	  to get back to your corpse.  Be aware that camping on the
	  'other' side of a rogue or item-locked door can trap you there
	  or make life difficult if something (LD, Death) happens to your
	  key'd party member. Basement CR is easiest, as there are
	  numerous ok place to camp down there and its easy to invis to
	  the spot you wiped.  Third floor boss wipe-outs will mostly
	  require coffins.</p>

	  <p>With the POP addition of rogue 'Shroud of Stealth' and the
	  keyring, most of the truly hideous CR issues can be avoided.  If
	  your rogue doenst have SoS you still may need to be aware of
	  where you are fighting and any possible CR concerns. ie: your
	  key'd puller dying behind a locked door. Oops.</p>

	  <h3>Sneak</h3>

	  <p> Agro radius on the mobs here (for the most part) is SUPER
	  small.  Using monk sneak (a much neglected monk skill, imo), you
	  can get almost anywhere.  You can literally walk over their
	  tails at times. You can also dash past some of em before they
	  notice you, even w/o sneak.  Just be prepared for a train if
	  that doesn't work for you.  I have rather fond memories of
	  sneak-draggin some bodies out of AL's chamber and down to the
	  first floor..</p>


	  <h3>Guided Tour</h3>

	  <p> I started with some maps on EQMaps and editted them to
	  include mob locations. And yes, I've spent THAT much time in
	  Ssra that I know where all the mobs spawn.  :( It helps that I'm
	  often pulling. </p>

		<h4>Basement</h4>

		<p> The Basement is divided into three main areas. The
		'Ghetto', the Mines and the Temple.  Cursed bosses are
		contained here, as well as a smattering of named Shissar and
		skeletons for item and quest drops.</p>

		<blockquote>

		  <p><b>The Ghetto</b>: The 'Ghetto' (lots of sick people and
		  trashy little houses) occupies the northern third of the
		  basement and contains mostly green non-agro mobs and an NPC
		  that explains how to do some quests.  Two of the Cursed
		  trigger Taskmasters live here as well. A Roaming Taskmaster
		  (TM) has it's spawn point just inside the entrance. </p>

			<p align="center"><img alt="ghetto" src="ssraGhetto.gif"/></p>

		  <p><b>The Mines</b>: The Mines occupy the southern third of
		  the basement. There's large minecart between two buildings,
		  with some tracks leading into a cave full of skeletons.  On
		  the far east side, behind the building, is a forge for
		  making Shissar bane weapons.  The area around the minecart
		  and forge are safe places to AFK and/or camp out.  The
		  buildings contain shissar and four of the Cursed trigger
		  Taskmasters.  </p>

		  <p>The caves are densely packed with agro-passing
		  skeletons. These make great AE groups if you can handle the
		  unstunnable named (marked on map with a yellow star).  The
		  Lucid Shards (VT Key quest) and Strange Green Ore (Shissar
		  Bane quest) drop in the skele caves. At the far end of the
		  mines is a dead end.  On the other side is a one-way zone to
		  TheDeep.  If you fight the Thought Horror Overfiend, there's
		  an exit from his room that zones you into the back of the
		  ssra skele cave behind a one-way rock door.  You can't zone
		  from Ssra into theDeep tho. </p>

		<p align="center"><img alt="mines" src="ssraMines.gif"/></p>

		  <p><b>The Temple</b>: The Central section of the basement is
		  home to two roaming Cursed trigger taskmasters and a random
		  roamer. The buildings on the east side contain a number of
		  static mobs. A locked section of the complex contains two
		  Cursed trigger Rhothz.  When a raid is doing the Cursed
		  Cycle, the Boss mobs spawn on the top (purple star) of the
		  east side builings. </p>

		<p align="center"><img alt="temple" src="ssraTemple.gif"/></p>


		</blockquote>


		<h5>Taskmasters / Rhozths</h5>

		<p>The Taskmasters are part of the Cursed cycle (see more
		details below) and are marked on the map as purple squares.
		Two of them roam from the mines to the ghetto and back.  Two
		of them have permanent homes in the ghetto, and there are four
		in the buildings outside the mines. Two larger snakes, the
		Rhozths, live in the secret-door/rogue accessible top of the
		eastern temple.  </p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="pagea">

		<h4>Second Floor</h4>

		<p> The Second Floor consists of two disjoint sections
		accessed from different tubes on the first floor.  The
		southern half is the lair of Rhag2, and the northern section
		contains seperate tubes for access to the 3rd Floor Arch Lich
		and High Priest / Creator areas. There's two named shissar you
		can camp, The Shissar Mystic and Commander2.</p>

			  mobs.</p> </td>

              and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=19711">Zazuzh's Key</a>).

			</tr>
		  </table>

		</blockquote>

	  </div>

	  <div class="pageb">

		<h4>Third Floor</h4>

		<p>The Third Floor contains the tougher bosses: High Priest,
		XtC (Creator), Arch Lich and the Blood/Emperor Rooms. It is
		almost exclusively for raiding with the possible exception of
		farming quest items (Insigs) for the Emperor key.</p>

				<p>The doors in the hallway connecting the two rooms
				are rogue-locked. The 2nd room contains the portal to
				the Blood / Emperor room and requires the Ring of the

      (generally casters) will run and should probably be snared.
      The '<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7108">dressed</a>'
      ones don't run.</p>


	  <div class="pagea">
		<h4>First and Second Floors</h4>

		<p>The mobs on the 2nd floor are slightly harder than their
		cousins of the same name on the first floor. For instance, the
		Elite Guards on the first floor are easily mezzable, while the
		ones on the 2nd floor were not. (at least pre level 65)</p>

        <p>The Elite mobs visibly carry weapons of various sorts:
        Ulak's, daggers, swords, etc.  These can be combined with ore
        from the basement to make Shissar Bane Weapons. (See quests
        below). </p>

	  <p>I like my XP to include a chance at named mob. Its more fun
	  to have the possibility of some loot drops. As such, here's the
	  spots I've found where you can camp certain named mobs for a
	  chance at their 'phat' lewts.
		</p>


	  <div class="pagea">
		<h3>Basement</h3>

		<p><a href="ssra0basement.gif"><img alt="basement" width="200" align="left" src="thumb_ssra0basement.gif"/></a>
		The Basement is divided into three main areas. The
		'Ghetto', the Mines and the Temple.  The Ghetto occupies the
		northern third of the basement and contains mostly green
		non-agro mobs and an NPC that explains how to do some quests.
		Some of the Cursed Trigger Taskmasters live here as well.
		Click the thumbnail for a larger image of the basement
		area.</p>

		<h4>Taskmasters</h4>

        <p>While nominally part of the Cursed trigger, these fellows
        are level 60 mobs with a 2 hour spawn time.  People sometimes
        xp on them, or camp them for the 'Taskmaster Pouch', their
        part in the Emperor Key quest.  However, the pouch is an
        actual 4-slot container, which most people don't have room to
        carry around.  For this reason, getting a Taskmaster pouch is
        often the last mob to camp for your Emp Key.</p>



		<h4>Kunark Skeles</h4>

        <p>Marked on the basement map with yellow stars, these have
        definate spawn points. The first three are easily camped from
        the mine entrance. It requires some determination to camp the
        other three from zone in. If you're after Sssra Bane weapons,
        you want to kill as many of these as you can, as each can drop
        the strange green ore you're after.</p>

       <p>The elusive 'Dusty Soriz Worker Pouch' also drops here.
       Many is a time i've camped this with other monks or pullers who
       want a free plentiful supply of pulling items. The pouch drops
       from a specific named Skele, Hilbog Jasarth, who spawns at the
       2nd yellow star in the mines.

       <br/><img alt="pouch" src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/rpics/a_dusty_soriz_worker_pouch2.jpg"/>

		from a monkly persepective.  They were posted at

		<h4>Guard Sklinus</h4>

        <p>Cocodrilo from Monkly Business says this guy is in the
        basement somewhere and 'never drops his caster-only haste
        belt'. He's supposed to be in the eastern temple, ground floor
        level.</p>

		<h4>Defiler Juzlix</h4>
		<p>Often found looking out over the southern balcony of the
		temple, Defiler Juzlix can drop this mask, as well as the
		'belt' booby prize.

		<h4>Prime Educator Ghozik / Arch Tormentor Zhesz</h4>

		  <p>These interesting sounds named can be found in the far
		  east side of the basement, on the upper/middle level of the
		  temple. However much fun they are to kill, they've never
		  dropped anything interesting, aside from the items on the
		  global ssra loot table. They have really cool names tho. And
		  there's a bunch of greenie captive NPC's that they seem to
		  be lecturing / torturing. Neat.</p>

		<h3>First Floor</h3>

		<p><a href="ssra1st.gif"><img alt="1st" width="200" align="left" src="thumb_ssra1st.gif"/></a></p>

		<p>With the exceptions noted above in 'Getting Around', you
		can invis thru most of the first floor. Here's the same map
		from above, for convenience. Click for a larger image. </p>

		<h4>Commander Zazuzh</h4>

		<p>Otherwise known as 'Comm1', Zazuzh can spawn at ANY 'blue'
		snake spot on the first floor map.  Normally people camp him
		for his part in the Emperor key quest, 'Zazuzh's Idol'.  He
		rarely drops a /keyring'able key, imaginately titled 'Zazuzh's
		Key', that opens the 2nd floor door to the Arch Lich toob.</p>

	   <p>Our favorite spot to camp him was the first floor toob room
	   to AL/xTC/HP area.  From zone-in, take a right passed the
	   see-invis snake and set up in one of the corners of the first
	   floor toob room.  With a little practice, your puller can keep
	   all nine first-floor spawn points dead, as well as pulling the
	   same nine spots from up the toob to the 2nd floor.  In this
	   fashion, you can camp 'comm1' and 'comm2' at the same time. </p>

		<p>Reference: <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8868">Commander Zazuzh</a></p>

		<h4>Shissar Assassin</h4>

		 <p>Bring a rogue if you plan on camping this fellow, for he
		 lives behind a rogue-lock'd door.  His room is right before
		 the toob to the 3rd floor 'Insignia/Blood/Emp' toob.  He can
		 spawn at any of the spots in the room, so your best tactics
		 is to pick a spot (the entrance hall sometimes works, as does
		 a corner, or a corner in the toob room) and clear the entire
		 room.</p>

		<p>Most of the times you'll be after his Illusion mask for a
		Bard/Rog who's collecting the racial illusions.  He drops the
		kitty mask as his rare.</p>

		<h4>Zhroushe Mezhkazh</h4>

		<p>To get to this guy's static spawn point, invis up and head
		towards the basement.  Once you pass the Rhag-1 room, this
		fellow or his PH lives in a little cubby with 3 snakes. You
		can easily set up camp in the hallway before the basement toob
		and pull from his cubby, the Rhag-1 anti-chamber, or the
		basement toob room. </p>

		<p>If you're camping this guy, it's mostly to get the ENC
		spell, 'Illusion: Vah Shir'. Which is, of course, his
		rare.</p>

		<p>Reference: <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10690">Zhroushe Mezhkazh</a></p>

		<h4>The Shissar Magister</h4>

		<p>This named occupies another of the three-spawn 'cubbies',
		the very first one you'd come to if you were heading to the
		basement.  From zone-in, head due west and take the middle
		door.  At the T-intersection, take a right and proceed to the
		dead end.  I don't really know why you'd camp this guy. </p>

		<h3>Second Floor</h3>

		<p><a href="ssra2nd.gif"><img alt="2nd" width="200" align="left" src="thumb_ssra2nd.gif"/></a></p>

		<p>The 2nd floor is split into two distinct sections that are
		inaccessible to each other once you're up there.  In order to
		get from one to the other, you'd have to go back down to the
		first floor and work your way around.  If you're on the 2nd
		floor and you're not raiding Rhag2 or heading to the 3rd floor
		bosses, you're likely trying to camp Commander2 for the
		ring/key quest.  See the 'getting around' section above for
		notes about locked doors.</p>

		<h4>Commander Zherozsh</h4>

	    <p>Commander Zherozsh (Comm2) can appear from any blue-dot mob
	    on the map, tho personally I've never seen him behind the
	    locked doors to the AL or HP/xTC toobs.  If you've decided to
	    camp Comm-2 from the 2nd floor, my favorite spot is at the
	    t-intersection directly south from the room with the toob to
	    the first floor.  From here you plenty of snakes to kill in
	    the hopes of spawning Comm2.  Once you get the key to the
	    HP/xTC toob, you can pull the placeholders for the Shissar
	    Mystic (see below) as well.  Don't forget to snare the
	    runners, or sometimes they'll run down the toob to the first
	    floor and train / summon you.</p>

		<p>Reference: <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8867">Commander Zherozsh</a></p>

		<h4>Shissar Mystic</h4>

		  <p>The Shissar Mystic likes to spawn near the High Priest /
		  Creator toob room.  I frequently find him in the 3-spawn
		  cubby with the locked coffin, or as one the two 'guards'
		  directly beyond the locked coffin.  Oddly enough, I've seen
		  TWO of these guys up at once.  </p>

		  <p> He drops the shaman spells, 'Acumen of Dar Khura' and
		  'Primal Essense', so sometimes you'll be camping this mob
		  for your favorite shammy. </p>

		<h3>Third Floor</h3>

		<p><a href="ssra3rd.gif"><img alt="3rd" width="200" align="left" src="thumb_ssra3rd.gif"/></a></p>

		<p>Primarily home to boss fights or staging areas, the 3rd
		floor is rarely visited for xp or quests.  The one notible
		exception is the 'hardest' part of the Emp Key/Shissar ring
		quest, the Insignia.  We used to only get Insignias via a
		mostly full raid force on our way to doing Empereror
		Ssra. Post-POP era toons may find camping these parts more
		manageable.</p>

		<h4>Insigna Mobs</h4>
		<p><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7859">General Kizuhz</a> |
		  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8733">Advisor Zekuzh</a> |
		  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7860">Arbitor Korazhk</a></p>

		  <p>After taking the toob up from the first floor, you're
		  dumped into an empty toob chamber.  Waiting outside are some
		  snakes who are quite a bit tougher than the common trash in
		  Ssra.  The door into the next chamber is locked, and
		  requires a rogue.  The next room contains a portal to the
		  Emperor chamber, surrounded by 16? or so mobs, any one of
		  which can be a placeholder for the three Insignia droppers
		  listed here. </p>

          <p>Each of the three Insignia mobs has a different special
          attack, so be prepared for it.  For example, one of them has
          an AE knockback, so you'll need to be prepared with proper
          placement and buffs, etc.  Once you've gotten your insignia,
          you've gotten the hardest part of the emperor key.  You can
          single-group (at level 60) the other 3 parts of the
          key. </p>

		  <p>The top of the toob room and the back of the portal to
		  the emperor areas are considered safe spots to afk , camp a
		  cleric or do final Call of Hero work.</p>

		<h4>Cell Block / Jail</h4>

		  <p>After someone with a Commander-2 key unlocks the 2nd
		  floor toob room, you can come up here. The area right before
		  Creator and High Priest has a number of non-targetable NPC's
		  imprisoned behind force fields, giving this area it's
		  informal name.  This is a safe place to afk , camp out, or
		  COH people for the nearby boss fights. </p>

	  <p>Ssra has a few quests in it. This section briefly lists the
	  quests.  Full Quest information is plentiful elsewhere on the
	  net, so this just highlights which areas and drops are for
	  quests. </p>

	  <div class="pagea">

		<h3>Ring of the Shissar: Emperor Key</h3>

		<p>Every person that wants to kill Blood / Emperor and
		eventually get access to Vex Thall (Luclin's endgame zone)
		needs a Ring of the Shissar. Aside from being a rather nice
		item for almost everyone, it opens the portal to the Blood/Emp
		room. It does /keyring and it can be destroyed afterwards
		while still allowing access to the Emp Portal.</p>

		<p><img alt="ring" width="326" height="128" src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/ring_shissar.jpg"/></p>

		<p>The quest requires you to acquire four NODROP pieces, one
		of which is a NODROP four-slot container, which means you
		can't MultiQuest the ring. Place the ring, the idol and the
		insignia in the pouch and hit combine -- its a NOFAIL
		combine. The items are listed from easiest to acquire to
		most difficult.  </p>

		<ul>
		  <li>Taskmaster's Pouch - Basement Taskmasters, Warden or Rhothz</li>
		  <li>Zazuzh's Idol - Commander 1</li>
		  <li>Zeruzsh's Ring - Commander 2</li>
		  <li>Ssraeshzian Insignia- General Kizuhx, Arbiter Korazhk, Advisor Zekuzh</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Most people dont have room for an extra container, so they
		leave the TM pouch for last, as it's easy to get. The pouch is
		the only item that doesnt drop every time, but there are 10
		pouch droppers that respawn every two hours. We used to get
		about 1:3 drop rate on pouches.  The Commanders and taskmaster
		can be single grouped and just require some time spent
		camping.  The Insignias are another matter. They're mean mobs
		with alot of hit points. Pre-POP, we did them with a minimum
		of 2 groups of 60s, though mostly it was 3 groups. </p>

		<h3>Key to Vex Thal (Lucid Shard)</h3>

		<p>To get into Luclin's 'end game' zone, Vex Thal, you need to

		well as some other steps, including getting an emperor key
		(see above). One of the shards you need to complete the key is

		<h3>Shissar Bane Weapons (Shissar Weapons)</h3>

		<p>The Emperor is invulnerable to any melee other than Shissar
		Bane weapons. You can create a variety of Shissar Bane weapons
		by combining the two items in the forge in the basement of
		Ssra. The combine is a NOFAIL combine and results in a NODROP
		weapon.  </p>

		<p>Monk/Bst weapon shown, but there are weapons for all classes.</p>

		  <li>Strange Green Ore - named skele (Kunark Skeles) in the basement mines</li>
		  <li>Shissar Weapon - 1st and 2nd floor Elite Shissar </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Kill named skeletons in the basement mines until you find a
		NODROP 'strange green ore'.  There are six named, each with
		their own distinct spawn location in the mines. The most
		efficient way to farm Ore seemed to be with AE groups, with
		melee tanking the unstunable named while the AE forces did
		their thing.</p>

		<p>Killing Elite Temple Guards commonly produces a 'shoddy'
		tradeable weapon of some sort.  When combined with the ore, it
		turns into a Shissar Bane weapon.</p>

		<p>Its never been clear to me if these weapons are Shissar
		Bane or Emperor Bane. Ie: should you use them against yard
		trash snakes?  Other ssra bosses? After all, a 14/20 Ulak is
		ok, but a 7/20 Ulak sorta sucks.  AC on mobs in Ssra varies
		wildly, from normal to INSANE, making it difficult to judge
		how effective a weapon is without actually parsing or paying
		more attention.  </p>

	  go right when the mob spawned.  So they all have a base respawn
	  time plus a random element. </p>

      <p>Luclin-era boss mobs were known for having MASSIVE amounts of
      hit points and/or AC, to the point where you'd literally spend
      20-30 minutes killing a single boss mob. So be prepared for some
      duration/endurance on the bigger of these boss mobs.  (Assuming
      my luclin-era memoriors are still valid).</p>

	  <p>As the 2nd-last Zone in Luclin, these fights are mostly
	  zergling proof. You'll need at least some mild raiding strategy
	  to win cleanly.  You'll have to deal with things like Rampage,
	  Flurries, various types of AE, mobs with lots of hit points,
	  mobs immune to various things, guards that respawn before you
	  have time to kill the boss, etc.  Each guild ends up with a
	  strat that works for them.</p>

		<h3>Rhags/AL</h3>

		<p>Collectively known as the 'Rhags', this series of mobs is
		the easiest set of Bosses in Ssra.  Each has their own
		distinct location w/in Ssra and loot tables, etc.  The death
		of Rhag1 will trigger the spawn of Rhag2, which in turn, will
		trigger the spawn of the Arch Lich.  You sometimes see Rhag2 up
		by itself (for instance) if someone has killed Rhag1, and
		didn't bother (or were unable) to go kill Rhag2. Ditto for
		Arch Lich if someone stopped at Rhag2. </p>


		<h4>Rhag Zhezum: Rhag 1</h4>

	    <p>The weakest of the Rhag's, this fellow is found on the
	    first floor, on the way to the basement. A well equipped
	    single group of Luclin-era 60s could handle this guy. </p>

	    <p>Killing this guy triggers Rhag2.</p>

	    <p>Respawn Time: 5 days +/- 12 hours  (used to be 3 days?)
		<br/>Reference : <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7828">Rhag Zhezum</a></p>

		<h4>Rhag Mozdezh: Rhag 2</h4>

	    <p>This 2nd floor Rhag take a bit of clearing to get to, and
	    there's quite a few normal snakes, and then a series of meaner
	    undead snakes guarding his lair.  2-3 well equipped Luclin-era
	    groups of 60s could handle this guy.</p>

	    <p>Killing this guy triggers the Arch Lich.</p>

		<p>Respawn Time: death of Rhag1 spawns me

		<h4>Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune: Arch Lich</h4>

	    <p>As the culmination of the Rhag series, this is the hardest
	    of the easy bosses.  Even to GET to his room, someone in the
	    raid has to have the Key to his toob (back on level 2) which
	    drops (rarely) from Commander1.  Once you unlock the door,
	    you've got to clear some of the meanest snakes you've seen
	    yet.  Approaching his room is a trap that can be disarmed and
	    then even MORE mean snakes with a pretty rapid respawn.  Then
	    there's AL's guards.. And finally, Mr. AL himself isn't a
	    pushover. </p>

		<h4>High Priest of Ssraeshza: HP</h4>

		<p>This guy lives in the right side fork of the Cell Block.
		Someone in the raid will need a key from Commander-2 to even
		get into the 2nd floor room with the Cell Block access
		toob. HP has a number of guards in his pillow-strewn room that
		can be dealt with in innovative ways. </p>

		<p>This guy lives in the left side fork of the Cell Block

		be disarmed. As a melee, the worst thing about this guy is his
		AE, which deduces your ATK (and therefore damage output) down

		<h3>Cursed Cycle/Event/Trigger</h3>

		<p>The basement boss is known as 'Cursed', and is really a
		series of 3 mobs (like the Rhag series) that spawn one after
		another.  Unlike the Rhags, once triggered, they WILL
		despawn. This also means you dont have an an infinite amount
		of time to wipe, redo buffs and try again.  </p>

        <p>If you kill the first mob in the series and then stop short
        of killing Cursed, the next raid to attempt the cycle gets a
        Placeholder mob for the one you killed.  This placeholder mob
        is almost identical in power/strength, but has NO LOOT.  This
        is to preserve the 'spirit' of the event.  You've got to be
        able to survive all three mobs to get the best loot, you can't
        skip directly to Cursed. </p>

		<h4>Taskmasters, Rhozths</h4>

	    <p>In order to spawn the Cycle, you'll have to kill all 7
	    Taskmaster, the roaming Warden, and the two Rhozth snakes in
	    the top of rogue-locked eastern temple.  You've only got a
	    limited amount of time to kill all of these, or the Cycle
	    won't start.  Nine of the 10 mobs you need to kill are on a 2
	    hour timer.  The 10th mob, Rhozth Ssrakezh, is on a
	    7 day? timer and controls how often Cursed is 'Up'. If you
	    don't make it all the way to Cursed and your current mob
	    despawns, you have to wait 24 hours? to try again when the
	    Rhozth Ssrakezh back up.</p>

		<p>Respawn: 2 hours for most, Limiting mob is Rhozth Ssrakezh, who is a) 24hrs?
		if someone tried and failed, and b) 7? days if Cursed died. </p>

		<h3>Blood/Emperor</h3>

		<p>This cycle is the final Boss of Sssra. Killing Blood and
		then Emp will not only get you some great loot, but it'll also
		drop a number of power-sources (keys) for Luclin's end-game
		zone, Vex Thal.  </p>

		<p>To get into this chamber every member of your raid will need to have completed the
		quest for the Emp Key/Shissar Ring (described above).  Once
		you zone into the area using your key, something happens that
		locks out late-comers.  So you can't zone into his area and
		wait, you'll need to assemble yoru raid force elsewhere
		(Insignia area usually) and then zone in all at once.  COH is
		disabled once you port thru the emp portal, requiring all raid
		members to have a key.</p>

        <p>For the fight itself, you need to kill whichever version of
        Blood | Golem is up (and deal with the rest of the room). When
        Blood | Golem dies, you have a few minutes before Emp spawns.</p>

		<p>if you're a melee and you'd like to feel useful killing
		Emp, you'll need to do the Ssra-bane weapon quest described
		above.  Normal weapons won't damage him.  However, if you have
		a weapon that procs some sort of Nuke or DoT, that will work,
		but you'll only be doing proc damage..</p>

	    <p>As far as I know, CR is not possible up here. If you wipe,
	    you're running back nekkid and using coffins.  A FD monk /
	    Necro won't help you much, as we were never able to discoveer
	    a safe recovery spot up there. </p>

	  <p>Thanks to the various folks back on Xegony who spent heaps of
	  time in Sssra with me on ring camps, spell camps, shissar fang
	  camps, VT Camps, and raiding the bosses. In no particular order:
	  Mellyn, Lumpus, Uffe, Kenuvan, Tenchii, Balladar, Vermeulenj.
	  And to <a href="http://www.loop.to/ic">Inner Circle</a>, my
	  first High End raiding guild. Thanks to Cocodrilo from
	  monkly-business for providing information about the cursed
	  Trigger and some more basement named. </p>
