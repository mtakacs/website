  </head>

    <h1>Jolo's Compiled Guide to EverQuest Baking from skill 0 to 135
    in 2-4 hours and 30pp (1). (Monk Chow)</h1>

    <P>This document was inspired by the EverQuest April 2001 changes
    making baking a useful skill for the common player. No more
    muffins and water. This guide shows you how to achieve 'Master'
    status (135 actually) in a few hours with minimal fuss and minimal
    outlay of platinum.  At Skill level 135 you can trivially bake
    almost any known stat-giving food.

    <h2>Guide for the impatient</h2>

    <P>A quick guide for the impatient.

    <Ul>
      <li>Go to Freeport
      <li>20 practice points in baking
      <li>Fish Rolls = batwing (west Freeport) + fish (east freeport) in oven (either zone)
      <li>Repeat until triv at 135
    </ul>

    <p>That's it. Read on if you care to.


    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    
    <P>Some folks advocate a progression thru the trivial levels. The
    advice usually goes like this: 'Start with something a few points
    higher then your current skill. Practice the skill until you reach
    the trival level.  Then change recipes to something slightly
    harder. Repeat.'  This works especially well when the components
    are expensive and you can't afford to fail often.

    <p>I find this process cumbersome.  It requires you to change
    recipes and seek out different component, some of which may be
    found only in rare places or from rare(ish) mobs.

    <p>An alternate approach is to pick a fairly simple recipe that
    trivials at a high level and practice ONLY that one recipe until
    it becomes trivial.  At the beginning levels, it's brutal. You
    rarely succeed in creating an item. However, your goal is NOT to
    make the items, but to get the skill bumps. And you get skill
    increases from failures.
      
    <h2>Food Progression</h2>
    
    <p>Foods are now consumed at different rates. My old standby,
    Muffins, are now classified as 'Snack' and are quickly consumed.
    Here's the progression table.  Drinks also have a duration
    associated with them.
      
    <p>
      <div align=center>
	
	<table border="1">
	  <tr>
	    <th>Food Type</th>
	    <th>Duration</th>
	    <th rowspan=6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
	    <th>Drink Type</th>
	    <th>Duration</th>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Snack</td>
	    <td>15 min</td>
	    <td>Whistle Wetter</td>
	    <td>15 mins</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Meal</td>
	    <td>30 min</td>
	    <td>Drink</td>
	    <td>30 min</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Hearty Meal</td>
	    <td>60 min</td>
	    <td>Refreshing Drink</td>
	    <td>45 mins</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Banquet</td>
	    <td>1.5 hours</td>
	    <td>Flowing Drink</td>
	    <td>xx</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Feast</td>
	    <td>2 hours</td>
	    <td>Enduring Drink</td>
	    <td>xx</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	</table>
      </div>

    <p>The durations are highly subjective.  It's fairly well accepted
    that the zone you're in effects your food consumptions. Most
    people seem to first notice a rapid consumption of drinks in
    Southern Desert of Rho, for instance.

    <p>More controversial is the effect of class, race, spells, and
    activity on the consumption of items.


    <h2>Fish Rolls - Monk Chow</h2>

    <p>I selected Fish Rolls for my Baking practice.  They have a
    simple recipe consisting entirely of components available from
    merchants and the trivial level is at 135.  As an added bonus,
    they're almost perfect for monks. They're light (0.1 weight) and
    last quite a long time (Banquet rating).

    <p><div align="center">
	<table border=1>
	  <tr>
	    <th>Food Item</th>
	    <th>Components</th>
	    <th>Combine</th>
	    <th>Trival</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Fish Rolls</td>
	    <td>1 Bat Wing, 1 Fresh Fish</td>
	    <td>oven or portable spit</td>
	    <td>135(8)</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </div>

    <p> <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQTraders</a> has trivials
    listed on their <a
    href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm">recipes
    page</a>, but the other recipes are slightly more complicated. I
    went for ease of use, brute force, no aux skills and a 1 recipe
    approach. 


    <h2>Locations</h2>

    <p>On Antonicia as a human monk, I was able to use Freeport as a
    base because the two components were located in adjacent zones -
    East Freeport (fish) and West Freeport (batwings).

    <p>If you're KOS in Freeport. you can have almost the same effect
    using East Commons(Batwings) and West Commons (fish from Barbarian
    fisherwoman), tho (I think) you need to carry a portable spit for
    these two zones.

    <p>On Kunark (or as an Iksar monk) , you've got a bit more
    work. You've still got two adjacent zones, but there's alot more
    hiking between the two. You'll be using Swamp of No Hope
    (batwings) and Firiona Vie (fresh fish).  FV?!?  But.. But I'm KOS
    there!  Never fear..  read on.  Or you can do the East/West
    Commons.

    <p>Thurgadin seems to support all tradeskills. Tho Apparently
    there are no batwing vendors (anywhere) in Velious. <strike>If you
    want to lug some in (or do clever tricks with Bind and gate
    potions) you can make Shark Rolls. Same deal as Fish rolls, but
    you use Shark Meat from the Meat Guy in Thurgadin.  If you want to
    stay native to Thurgadin, you can make Shark Filets (shark +
    spices + jug sauces), tho that trivs out at 82 and is a bit more
    expensive. </strike> (2)

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
      
      <li> Tradeskills are influenced by Int/wis (insert argument
	here), so gather/beg-borrow all your int/wis gear. If you can
	swing it, have a high level enchanter cast an int buff
	(Brillance) on you. Or whatever the equivalent wisdom buff. If
	you're a dumb-as-rocks monk like me (79 int), it helps speed
	things up, though it's NOT required. I did 70% of the work with
	just my base int. <p>
	
      <LI> Go to the bank, withdraw about <strike>30pp</strike>(1)
	50pp.  This should more than cover it, especially if you sell
	some of your successful fish rolls back to the merchant as you
	work. <p>
	
      <li> (optional) Go to your guild and dump 20 practice points
	into baking as a jump start. As a level 50 monk, I have hoards
	of practice points lying around since my highest trainable skill
	was back at level 35. And to top it off, I raised all my combat
	skills via use instead of practice points. <p>
	
      <li> (optional) Buy a bunch of backpacks to hold all the fish,
	batwings and finished fishrolls. The more space you can clear in
	your inventory, the less hiking back and forth (thru different
	zones) you'll have to do. 
	
    </ol>

    <h2>The Work</h2>

    <p>You're now ready to bake.

    <ol>
      
      <li> (optional) Buy a portable spit. This lets you avoid running
	back and forth to an oven. It's not really an issue in Freeport,
	but if you're doing this as a KOS-type in Kunark, it's almost a
	requirement.<p>

	<ul>
	  <li>East Freeport: Buy a spit at Trader Holiday.  Trader's
	    Holiday is located near the port Authority.  

	    <br>Or use the Ovens.  The West Freeport Oven is in the
	    empty hut near the crystalized pumice shop (herbal
	    supplies) near the monk guild and the EF zone in. The East
	    Freeport oven is in the back of a pub around the corner
	    from the port authority on the way to the South gate.
	    
	    <p><img src="freeport_ovens.jpg"> 
	      <br>Red = vendors, Blue = ovens/spits<p>

	  <li>Kunark: Buy a spit at vendor Klok Gritchit in Cabilis
	    East. I couldn't find a spit for sale in FV.  

	    <br>Or use the Ovens. In East Cabilis it's near the spit
	    vendor, (apparently) nearby (labelled as #7).  The Firione
	    Via Oven is located near the 3rd building on the right as
	    you enter the town by crossing the bridge from the
	    wilderness. KOS types will NOT be able to use this unless
	    they can sneak and risk wandering caster mobs.

	</ul><P>


      <li>Fill half your open inventory with Batwing stacks.  Buy
	whole stacks by SHIFT-clicking the purchase button. <p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Freeport: Go to West Freeport and buy Batwings from a
	    vendor in Acadamy of Arcane Sciences. You're looking for
	    Lysa Truegreen or Zasrin Blueflame.  I found Zasrin
	    Blueflame easy to reach. Go inside the guild and up on the
	    2nd floor. <p>
	    
	  <li>Kunark: Buy Batwings from vendor Klok Migo in the Swamp
	    of No Hope. Tho he's actually in the outskirts of East
	    Cabilis, inthe ruins on the 2nd floor.  (If you avoid the
	    troopers and Crusaders, you can even trade with this guy as
	    a human monk using sneak and standing behind him).

	    <br><img src="swamp_map.jpg"><p>

	</ul>

      <li>Fill the other half of your open inventory with Fresh Fish
	stacks. Buy whole stacks by SHIFT-clicking the purchase button. <p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Freeport: Go to East Freeport.  Buy Fresh fish stacks
	    from any vendor (Tanlok Harson, Iseba Gargurd &amp; Tarker
	    Gargurd) in the Port Authority building. <p>

	  <li>Kunark: Go to FV. Buy Fresh fish stacks from vendor Dorg
	    McMerin (building at -3898, 1663). Here's where KOS types
	    have to use sneak or bribe someone.  The vendor is
	    conveniently located on the dock leading to the Boat.  As a
	    KOS iksar, you can swim south from the shoreline and climb
	    onto the docks via a ladder at the extreme east end.  Then
	    run down to the set of buildings sticking off the north side
	    of the pier.  Doug is inside the first building. While I'm
	    not KOS here, the only guards I saw were stationed at the
	    Boat loading area. During the short time I was there to buy
	    fish, no wandering guards pathed thru that area.  

	    <br>If you can't sneak-buy, you'll have to bribe someone
	    to purchase them for you. Or work on your fishing skills.
	    
	    <br><img src="fv_map.jpg"><p>

	</ul>

      <li>(optional) Rearrange your inventory.  When you've got the
	oven or spit open, you can only have one other container open.
	So before I baked, I'd re-arrange my components so that each bag
	was half full of fish and half batwings.  This will save
	excessive clicking when you're actually baking. <p>
	
      <li>Make Sushi!  You've now got stacks of fish and
	batwings. Move to a safe location if you need to.  Using either
	your portable spit or oven.  <p>

	<ul>
	  <li>click the oven or spit. It should open. <p>

	  <li>open your first pack with 50/50 batwings/fish <p>

	  <li>(optional) rearrange the windows. I put the oven on the
	    far left, the bag very close to the oven display,and the
	    auto-equip slot visible to the right of the bag.  I found
	    this worked best with minimal mousing .. still got cramped
	    up from clicking, but it wasn't as bad. ;) <p>
	    
	  <li>CTRL-click to get one batwing from the stack. Place in oven/spit. <p>

	  <li>CTRL-click to get one fish from the stack. Place in oven/spit. <p>
	    
	  <li>hit combine.  You'll either fail, fail + skill increase,
	    succeed, or succeed + skill increase. If you happen to get a
	    fish roll, drop it in the auto-equip slot and continue. They
	    stack, which is nice. At early levels, you'll fail almost
	    constantly, so you don't need to save a slot. At higher
	    levels (80+) you'll suceed fairly often, so I left a pair of
	    slots bat/fish free so I could hold the fish rolls, which I
	    sold next time I went back. <p>
	    
	</ul>
	
      <li>When you've exhausted you supply, buy more from
	whichever vendor is in your current zone, then go to the
	other zone and stock up.  If you've got a spit, you can park
	right there. Otherwise, you'll need to find the new oven. <p>
	    
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The Result</h2>
    
    <p>After four hours (over 2 days), approximately 50 pairs of
    batwing/fish stacks, using no int buffs (int 79, no one on at the
    time to buff me and no int gear) I maxed out at 135.  I was
    getting about 1 skill bump per 15 attempts. It was sorta bursty
    too... sometimes I'd get 4 skill bumps per stack, sometimes I'd go
    thru a whole stack w/o anything.
      
    <p>When I told my /guild about my ratio, a wiz with 200+ int waltz
    in and triv'd out at 135 while I was plodding thru the 80s. Her
    rate was 1 in 4. So buff up if you can.

    <p>Selling the fishrolls helps offset the costs, but it's a pretty
    cheap skill to raise as the components cost a silver and some
    copper each.

    <h2>Advanced Baking - Stat foods</h2>

    <p>At skill level 135, you can make almost all the stat bonus
    skills. Most of those, however, require hunting down components
    that drop from various mobs.  Or they require auxilary tools from
    a potter or a blacksmith.  

    <p>However, you can make SOME stuff fairly easily. For example, in
    Thurgadin, the Meat Guy (Mordin Frostcleaver - Mordin's Meats)
    sells bear, scorpion, lion, gator, rat, snake and
    <strike>shark</strike>.
      
    <h3>Rat Kabobs</h3> 
    
    <p>Rat Kabobs have a +1 dex/agi bump if they're the food currently
    being eaten. They weight 0.1, but are only classified as a
    (hearty?) meal, so go more quickly than a stack of fish rolls.
    Nevertheless, if you're a dex/agi junkie...

    <ol>
      <li>Prep: /auction for a skewer. This is an item made by a
	blacksmith. Trivs at 115 (metal bits, skewer mold, flask of
	water).  I got lucky, a smith was practicing smithing using
	these, so she gave me one.  You only need one. It's not "eaten"
	during the baking process. <P>
	
      <li>Thurgadin bank - buy Jug of Sauces, and Spices from Perkins
	Doughbeard (bank). <p>

      <li>Thurgadin Meat Shop - buy rat meats from Mordin
	FrostCleaver. <p>

      <li>Thurgadin Oven - it's in the meat shop.  <p>
	
      <li>Combine: 1 skewer + 1 jug + 1 sauce + 1 rat meat.  <p>

      <li>If you've got 135 baking from this guide, you should get a
	rat kabob every time.  I bought 2 stacks of each component and
	made 39 rat kabobs. (1 failure). Once you place the rat kabob in
	your inventory, your skewer re-appears on your cursor. <p>

    </ol>

    <h3>Other Stats foods</h3>

    <p>The other monkly stat food might be Kobold Steaks (+1 str/sta),
      but I haven't heard of Kobold meat being available from vendors.

    <p>Aug 2001: Now that I'm in Velious alot, I'v got easy access to
      lots and lots of Frost and Storm giant meat.  I currently favor
      Frost Giant steaks (+$ str/+1 sta) tho it requuies a trip to
      Cobalt Scar to get the best vendor spices.
      
    <p>There's an       <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm">EQTraders
	Chart</a> as well as an <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessageRange?topicID=471.topic">EZBoard
	thread</a> discussing stat foods.

    <h3>Vendor Mining</h3>

    <p>Until recently, I had no idea merchants had 'back inventory'
      that you couldn't see.  So maybe I could have gotten that rare
      quest gem I accidentally sold to a merchant back if I'd known
      about this dumpster diving technique.  Basically you have to buy
      out his supply of crap so his other stuff gets rotated into stock.
      
    <p>Here's two EZTraders thread on the subject: 
      <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=216.topic">Question</a>, 
      <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=80.topic">Guide</a>

      <P>This can be useful if you're looking for some rare food item
      that you think someone might have sold to a vendor.

    <h2>Food Tactics</h2>

    <p>So you finally got some Wyvern meat from CS and make Pickled
      Wyvern for it's +3 Magic Resist.  Yet you really don't want to be
      eating that rare food all the time. Especially if you're sitting
      on a boat.  

    <p>Luckily there's a way to make yer food last forever.

    <h3>Force Feeding</h3>

    <p>This is my preferred method of 'infinite stat food'.

    <p>Fast Right-clicking on foods/drinks now consumes them in mass
    quantities, much like drinking alchohol. The durations are halved,
    but you can fill up with 'non-stat' food. Since you 'filled up' on
    the junk-food, you never actually consume the stat food, but you
    still get the stats bumps. 

    <p>Good sources of junk food == Foraged stuff from yer friendly
    Druid/Ranger. Also Summoned:black bread from yer local
    quickie-mart, er mage.  Or the aforementioned Fish Rolls. ;)

    <h3>Food Swapping</h3>

    <p>This is the Pain in the Ass method of 'infinite stat food'.

    <p>The food currently beig eaten (and giving you stat bonuses, if
      any) goes in this order, from First (1) to Last (8).  Any bags
      placed in slots are used in the same order. Slots w/in the bag are
      consumed in a similar order.

      <center>
	<table border=1>
	  <tr>
	    <th colspan=2>Inventory Slots</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Inv 1</td>
	    <td>Inv 5</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Inv 2</td>
	    <td>Inv 6</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Inv 3</td>
	    <td>Inv 7</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Inv 4</td>
	    <td>Inv 8</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      <p>So I've got my cheapie Fish Rolls in a bag in slot 5.  My
      Pickled Wyvern (+3mr) and Ragt Kabobs (+1 agi/dex) are "hidden"
      down in a bag in slot 8. If i remember, I'll swap food locations
      when I'm fighting casters (Wyvern to front), vs Tanks (Rat
      kabobs to front) vs traveling (fish rolls).  

      <p> If I had 2 free inventory slots, I'd make hotkey pads for
      slots 4 and slots 8 and switch things around during combat.  I
      usually just forget and end up eating all my rat kabobs and
      forgetting about my Wyvern pickles.

      <p>If you're REALLY into micromanagment, you can put a stat food
      in the 'hot slot'. Right as it's about to be eaten (you
      apparently need a timer), you swap it out for a cheapie food
      item (fish-roll). Then the hunger timer resets according to the
      cheapie food (fish rolls work well as they are banquet).  Put
      the expensive stat bonus food back in place and you've got stat
      food until you get hungry again.  Talk about micromanagement and
      getting the last crump.


    <H2>Closing</h2>

    <p>This is entirely a derivative work. The only thing vaguely
    original is that it was assembled all in one place and I added
    some pictures.  I've made extensive use of such guides on other
    sites and other topics and hope this contributes back somewhat.

    <H2>Updates</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li> 7/10/2001 - Patch "nerfs" fish rolls --
	
	<blockquote>
	  "Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets. All
	  fish vendors should return to normal, but they won't be
	  paying as well for certain fishy items. This resolves a
	  problem that was created with the increased value of player
	  made food items all over Norrath. Some of food items were
	  made too valuable, and merchants were complaining to their
	  union leaders...
	</blockquote>
	
	The upshot is now it costs more like 40-50p to get all the way
	to skill 135, as the resale of Fish Rolls got less
	"lucrative".
	
      <li>6/2001 - <a
      href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html">Patch
      removes Shark Meat</a>

	<blockquote>To fix [ quest exploit ] we had, really, two
	choices. Remove the quest or remove the meat from vendors. We
	chose to remove the meat.
	</blockquote>

	Oh well. No shark roll option in Thurgadin.
